# CLAUDE.md — Frappe Migration 101

The primer. If you (LLM or human) just walked into this project, read this in full before doing anything else. Every claim below is sourced from a doc in this folder — follow the wikilinks for detail.

> **Read this first — what this file describes.** The sections further down (folder convention, "What lives where") describe the **Obsidian vault** (`Frappe Migration 101/`), which is the strategy/docs home. **This git repo (`tatva_frappe_custom`) is the CODE home** — its canonical layout is the next section. Rule of thumb: prose/strategy/runbooks → vault; code + buildable artifacts → this repo.

> **Repo home:** **https://github.com/devops-tatvacare/tatva_frappe_custom** (public). The single working repo for the custom Frappe app (WATI override, Acefone telephony, future overrides) **and** the API docs site.
>
> **Two deploy lanes (keep them straight):**
> - **App code** (WATI/Acefone) → bake into the custom Docker image → reinstall (`apps.json` → rebuild `tatva-frappe:1.x` → `install-app`/`migrate`/`build`). Changes occasionally.
> - **Docs content** (`api-docs/`) → fast file push: `VM_SSH_HOST=… VM_SSH_PW=… ./api-docs/deploy-docs.sh` → lands in the Frappe `sites` volume, served by nginx at `/docs`. Changes often; **never** rides the image rebuild.
>
> Secrets (VM host/password) are **env vars**, never committed — this repo is public.

## This repository — canonical layout (codified, do not reinvent)

`tatva_frappe_custom` is a **standard Frappe app repo** (installable via `bench get-app`) that also carries the API docs site. Layout grounded in the live `frappe/crm` + `frappe/helpdesk` apps and the [official Frappe app docs](https://docs.frappe.io/framework/user/en/basics/apps).

```

├── nginx/frappe.conf.template       # Frappe frontend nginx template + the permanent /docs route
├── pyproject.toml                   # ★ app packaging — Frappe v15 uses pyproject.toml, NOT setup.py
├── README.md   license.txt   .gitignore   # .gitignore excludes node_modules/, dist/, __pycache__/
```

**Codified rules (so we never re-decide):**
1. **Scaffold with `bench new-app <app_name>`** — never hand-build the skeleton. `app_name` is snake_case (valid python identifier); the repo/GitHub name can differ (`tatva_frappe_custom`).
2. **`pyproject.toml`, not `setup.py`** — the v15 standard (older Frappe docs still show `setup.py`/`requirements.txt`; ignore that). Verified in the live `crm`/`helpdesk` apps.
3. **All customization goes through `hooks.py`**: `doc_events` (validate / on_update), `override_doctype_class` (swap a controller), `override_whitelisted_methods` (swap an API), `scheduler_events` (cron), `app_include_js/css` (assets). No monkey-patching scattered elsewhere.
4. **Schema as code via fixtures** — put `fixtures = ["Custom Field", "Property Setter", ...]` in `hooks.py`, run `bench export-fixtures`. Custom fields/property setters become version-controlled JSON, auto-applied on `bench migrate`. ★ This is the real "don't reinvent" win — it replaces the manual field creation in redeploy-runbook Phases 11–12.
5. **Docs live in `api-docs/`** (build/deploy via `api-docs/deploy-docs.sh`; the `/docs` nginx route is `nginx/frappe.conf.template`). See [[project_docs_portal]] / vault runbook Phase 17.
6. **Install path:** `bench get-app <repo-url>` → `bench --site crm.local install-app <app_name>` → for prod, add to the custom image's `apps.json` and rebuild (vault runbook Phases 2–3).

## What this folder is

The single source of truth for the TatvaCare Frappe CRM migration. Replaces LeadSquared. One Frappe install on one Azure VM. One folder for everything: infra, app config, data model, migration, integrations, runbooks, scripts.

This used to be scattered across `Architecture/`, `Decisions/`, `Developer/`, `Investigations/`, `Memory/`. All consolidated into here 2026-06-01. The old sub-folders no longer exist in the vault.

Folder convention:
- `NN-kebab-case.md` files (`NN` = 2-digit order within folder)
- Every doc has YAML frontmatter (`title`, `status`, `updated`)
- Wikilinks `[[file-name]]` use the **filename slug** (not path) — Obsidian resolves
- `99-archive/` holds superseded docs (never delete; one-line "superseded by" note when known)
- `scripts/` holds the executable scripts (vmssh, schema bootstrap, migration scripts)

## The 60-second context

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What does this Frappe install hold? | Patient Support Program **leads** for TatvaCare. Replacing LeadSquared. |
| Where? | One Azure VM (`goodflip-care-frappe`, 4 vCPU / 16 GB RAM / 60 GB disk). |
| URL? | `https://one.tatvacare.in` (HTTPS terminated by an external Azure ingress, not the VM). |
| Stack? | Docker compose (11 services declared / 10 running steady-state) — `tatva-frappe:1.1` custom image with `frappe + crm + telephony + helpdesk + payments + lms`. |
| DB? | MariaDB 11.8 inside container `crm-db-1`. Site = `crm.local`. |
| Auth? | `Authorization: token <key>:<secret>` — but **API keys run the user's role/perm checks**, they do NOT bypass perms. |
| Data model? | **Lean core (~26 fields on CRM Lead) + 3 child "profile" doctypes** (Oncology / MyTatva Health / Metabolic). New verticals = new profile doctype, not new column. |
| Dedup key? | `mobile_no` (verified — 0 collisions on 11,762 prior leads). Format convergence to E.164 pending. |
| Status types? | New(Open) · Contacted/Nurture(Ongoing) · Qualified/Converted(Won) · **Junk/Unqualified(Lost — both require `lost_reason`)**. |
| Routing chain? | `Vertical (Product Line) → Group → Program`. All Links to lookup doctypes, all permlevel-1 (manager-only). |
| Custom endpoint? | One: `POST /api/method/upsert_lead_by_phone` — finds-or-creates a lead by `mobile_no`. Has a known silent-200 bug pending fix. |

## How to use this folder when working a task

| Task | Start at |
|---|---|
| "How do I rebuild this on a new VM?" | [[01-infrastructure/06-redeploy-end-to-end]] |
| "What does the data model look like?" | [[03-crm/01-data-model]] then [[03-crm/03-custom-fields-inventory]] |
| "How do I write a lead from an external system?" | [[03-crm/04-server-scripts-and-apis]] |
| "Why does the right pane show 19 tabs?" | [[03-crm/12-ui-layouts-state]] |
| "Why doesn't `read_only` work on a child table grid?" | [[03-crm/08-frappe-code-reads]] — Grid.vue has no read_only prop |
| "What stage is the migration at?" | [[04-migration/01-migration-overview]] |
| "I need to SSH the VM" | [[01-infrastructure/01-vm-and-access]] then `scripts/vmssh.sh` |
| "How do I add a Frappe app?" | [[02-apps/03-adding-frappe-apps-runbook]] |
| "WATI / Ozonetel design?" | [[05-integrations/01-wati-whatsapp]] · [[05-integrations/02-ozonetel-telephony]] |

## Standing user direction (DO NOT depart from these)

1. **LSQ + Frappe are first-class peers**, not sidecar. Both fire on every event until Frappe achieves "high fidelity", THEN we remove LSQ writes. Never call Frappe a fallback/secondary.
2. **WATI is non-negotiable** — chatbot flows + templates already on WATI. Never suggest Meta Cloud direct as a swap; always fork-and-port.
3. **No prod-snapshot/downtime warnings** unless the user says it's live to customers. The install is private to the team via VPN today.
4. **Plain English. Tight responses.** No jargon walls. No option matrices — propose ONE thing, ask if it's good. User is product-fluent, not DevOps; give exact commands for infra tasks. No closing summaries.
5. **No upstream contributions.** This is a private fork. Don't open PRs to `frappe/frappe`, `frappe/crm`, etc.
6. **Confirm before non-trivial edits.** For multi-step work: 3-5 bullet plan, then wait. "Update and stop" means stop — no verification, no Playwright, no "let me also fix this."
7. **Never guess library APIs.** Read source / Context7 / `--help`. Don't fabricate config values or pretend access exists.
8. **Phone format converges to E.164** (`+919999000123` — no hyphens, no spaces) once we own all writers. Migrated data is currently `+91-XXXXXXXXXX` — needs normalize-then-lock.
9. **Side Panel default-open rule: only the FIRST tab `opened: true`, all others `opened: false`.** Apply to every doctype's Side Panel (CRM Lead, CRM Deal, Contact, Organization, etc.) — agent never sees a wall of expanded sections. Whoever lays out the side panel orders tabs so the most-used tab is first.

## Live state to remember (don't re-verify each turn)

- 23 leads in the system today (20 sample + 3 webhook-test). The 12,060-lead Anaya backfill was wiped during the model rebuild; re-migration is pending.
- 1 server script (`Upsert Lead By Phone`) — has a known silent-200 bug; fix paused.
- 6 custom doctypes; 28 CRM Lead custom fields.
- Side Panel has 19 ghost tabs; Data Fields has 1 empty tab. Both fixes paused per user.
- `server_script_enabled=1` is set at the COMMON config level (NOT site). If you ever rebuild, set it via `bench set-config -g`, not `bench set-config`.
- `frappe.crm` Grid.vue has NO `read_only` prop — governance needs permlevel-1 + a validate hook in `tatva_crm` (custom app, not yet built).
- `disable_document_sharing=1` does NOT stop the `lead_owner` auto-DocShare (owner-share leak).

## What's NOT in this folder (and that's intentional)

- **Code** — lives in `/Users/dhspl/dummy/scripts/` (vault has a copy under `scripts/`) and in the MyTatvaCore repo.
- **Backups** — DB dumps live on the VM, not in the vault.
- **Hourly memory** — operational state lives in the auto-memory system at `~/.claude/projects/-Users-dhspl-dummy/memory/`. A snapshot of the memory as-of-2026-06-01 is in `99-archive/memory-snapshot-2026-06-01/`.

## When you're about to do something risky

Examples: change a doctype's field, run a migration script, restart the backend, edit a Server Script, touch the Docker compose file, force-push, drop a table.

→ Pause. Explain in 3-5 bullets. Wait for user confirmation. Even if "the right thing to do" feels obvious. The user has been burned by autonomous edits.
