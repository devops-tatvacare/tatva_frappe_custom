# WATI WhatsApp integration (`tatva_connect.wati`)

This folder makes the CRM send and receive WhatsApp **only through WATI** — never
through Meta. WATI is our BSP; the chatbot flows and approved templates already
live there. The single hard rule everything below protects:

> **WATI only. No code path may ever reach Meta's WhatsApp API — not once.**

## How it plugs in (no CRM fork, no patches)

The CRM uses the open-source `frappe_whatsapp` app, which talks to **Meta** out of
the box. We do **not** edit `frappe_whatsapp` or `frappe/crm`. Instead `tatva_connect`
**overrides** the three pieces that would otherwise call Meta, via `hooks.py`:

| What | How it's redirected |
|---|---|
| `WhatsApp Message` (every manual / picker send) | `override_doctype_class` → `WATIWhatsAppMessage` |
| `WhatsApp Notification` (automated / scheduled sends) | `override_doctype_class` → `WATINotification` |
| `WhatsApp Templates` (create / edit / delete / fetch) | `override_doctype_class` → `WATITemplates` + `override_whitelisted_methods` for the "Sync" button |

Because these are framework-level overrides, the CRM's own UI and code stay
untouched — they just write a `WhatsApp Message` row like always, and our override
sends it via WATI. The agent's experience is the stock CRM, plus our template picker.

## What the integration does

**1. Outbound — three kinds of send**
- **Template** (anytime): the agent clicks **Send Template** on a lead → our picker
  opens (see Template variables below) → we POST to WATI `sendTemplateMessage`.
- **Session text** (free text, only inside WhatsApp's 24-hour window): `sendSessionMessage`.
- **Media / attachment**: the actual file bytes are uploaded to WATI
  (`sendSessionFile` / `sendSessionFileViaUrl`) — not the filename as text.

**2. Inbound — the webhook**
WATI POSTs the whole tenant's traffic to one guest endpoint. We verify a secret,
honour the kill-switch, drop everything that isn't a CRM lead, and only then store
the survivors (inbound customer messages + delivery/read statuses for messages we
sent). Inbound rows attach to the lead and show in its WhatsApp tab automatically.

**3. Templates**
Templates are **managed on WATI**, not in Frappe. We mirror them read-only into the
`WhatsApp Templates` doctype (the "Sync from WATI" button) so the picker has a list.
We never create, edit, or delete a template on the provider.

**4. Template variables (`{{1}}`, `{{2}}`…)**
When a template has variables, the picker shows the message with each slot
highlighted and gives the agent one input per slot — type a value, or pick a CRM
Lead / profile field from the dropdown. We send those values to WATI as named
params. This scales to any number of templates with **no per-template mapping**.

**5. Kill-switch**
`WATI Settings → Enabled`. When off, **both sending and receiving stop**. Default is
on (so a fresh install works), but the switch is checked fresh on every send and
every inbound event.

**6. Reconcile a lead's thread — the "Refresh WhatsApp" button**
On the CRM Lead header (leftmost, before Assign / Convert to Deal) there's a
**Refresh WhatsApp** button. Click it to pull the lead's **entire** WhatsApp
history from WATI (`getMessages`, all pages) and rebuild the thread — so any
discrepancy between what WATI has and what the CRM shows is rattled out.

It's built to be safe:
- **Scoped to that one lead.** It only ever touches that lead's rows — never any
  other lead's.
- **Authoritative + idempotent.** Each WATI message has a stable id; we key rows
  on it, so clicking twice gives the same result (no duplicates).
- **Never re-sends.** Rows are written directly to the database — clicking Refresh
  cannot fire a WhatsApp message.
- **Fetch-then-rebuild in one transaction.** If the WATI fetch fails, nothing is
  deleted; the old thread stays intact.
- Statuses (delivered/read/failed) and message times come straight from WATI.

**7. Scheduled template sync (every 6 hours)**
On top of the real-time manual sync, a scheduler job re-syncs **every** WATI
account's templates every 6 hours, so the local mirror is almost always current.
It respects the kill-switch and never crashes the scheduler on a sync error.
(Requires the bench scheduler to be enabled — it is on prod.)

## Setting up MULTIPLE WATI accounts + routing rules

Each WATI tenant (e.g. Anaya, GoodFlip) is its own WATI account with its own base
URL, its own templates, and its own WhatsApp number. In Frappe each maps to **one
`WhatsApp Account` record**. Here's the full setup for adding a second (or third…)
account without crossing wires.

### Step 1 — Create the WhatsApp Account (one per tenant)
Desk → **WhatsApp Account** → New:
- **URL**: the tenant base URL, e.g. `https://live-mt-server.wati.io/<tenant_id>`
- **Token**: the tenant's WATI JWT
- **Is WATI Account** (`custom_is_wati`): ✅ tick it
- **WATI Channel Number** (`custom_wati_channel_number`): that tenant's WhatsApp
  number (digits). This must be **unique** across accounts (enforced) — it's an
  inbound routing key.

### Step 2 — Sync that account's templates
Desk → **WhatsApp Templates** list → **Sync from WATI** (or run
`tatva_connect.wati.templates_sync.sync_from_wati` with no argument to sync **all**
WATI accounts at once). Templates are stored **per account** — the record name is
`templatename::Account Name`, so two tenants can both have e.g. `appointment_reminder`
without clobbering each other. The picker only ever shows the templates of the
account a given lead routes to.

### Step 3 — Add routing rules (who sends from which account)
Desk → **WATI Account Routing** → New. Each rule maps a slice of the lead taxonomy
to an account. A rule has up to three axes — **Product Line** (Vertical), **Group**,
**Program** — and a target **WhatsApp Account**. Leave an axis blank to mean "any".

A rule matches a lead **only if every axis it fills matches the lead**. Among all
matching rules, the **most specific wins**:

```
Program  (most specific)   beats   Group   beats   Product Line (least specific)
```

Examples:
| Rule | Means |
|---|---|
| Program = `Anaya Nivolumab` → Anaya account | leads in that program send via Anaya |
| Group = `Insurers` → GoodFlip account | any lead in the Insurers group (with no more-specific rule) sends via GoodFlip |
| Product Line = `Oncology` → Anaya account | a broad catch for all Oncology |
| (all three blank) → some account | an explicit catch-all (only if you choose to make one) |

**"Program = X **OR** Group = Y → same account"** is just **two separate rules**
both pointing at that account. They can't conflict.

### The guard-rails that keep it unambiguous
- **No global default.** If a lead matches **no** rule, the send is **blocked** with
  a clear error — we never silently fall back to some default tenant. (Configure a
  blank-axes catch-all rule if you actually want a default.)
- **No duplicate rules.** You can't save two rules with the identical
  (Product Line, Group, Program) combination — that's rejected on save.
- **No ambiguous tie.** If two equally-specific rules ever pointed at *different*
  accounts for one lead, the send raises instead of guessing.
- **Templates can't cross tenants.** The picker is scoped to the lead's routed
  account, so an agent can only pick a template that actually exists on the tenant
  the message will go out from. (No route → the picker says so and lists nothing.)

### Step 4 — Inbound: register the webhook per tenant
On **each** WATI tenant, register the inbound webhook URL and tell us which account
it belongs to by adding `&account=<WhatsApp Account name>`:

```
https://<host>/api/method/tatva_connect.wati.webhook.webhook?token=<secret>&account=<WhatsApp Account name>
```
- `<secret>` = **WATI Settings → Webhook Verify Token** (shared).
- `&account=...` tells us which tenant received the message, so inbound is filed
  under the right account **without** depending on any WATI payload field.

Inbound attribution order: the `account` in the URL first; then the WATI channel
number; then — only if exactly one WATI account exists — that one. With two+
accounts and no match, the message is still stored on the lead and the unresolved
tenant is logged for you to fix (never mis-filed to the wrong account).

## Day-to-day ops (quick reference)

| Task | Where |
|---|---|
| Turn WhatsApp on/off (send + receive) | Desk → **WATI Settings → Enabled** |
| Refresh the template list | **WhatsApp Templates** list → **Sync from WATI** (auto every 6h too) |
| Reconcile a lead's chat with WATI | the lead's **Refresh WhatsApp** button (header, leftmost) |
| Add a tenant | New **WhatsApp Account** (Step 1) + sync + routing rule + webhook |
| Change who sends from which account | **WATI Account Routing** rules |
| Map a template variable to a CRM field | open the template, set **Field Names** (optional; the picker also lets agents pick per-send) |
| See a lead's WhatsApp thread | the lead's **WhatsApp** tab (inbound + outbound + status ticks) |

## Notes / known limits
- **Templates with header/button (media, CTA) components**: the automated
  notification path sends the **body** params correctly; header/button params are
  not yet translated to WATI. Body-only templates are fully supported.
- The local `WhatsApp Templates` rows are a **read-only mirror** — edit templates on
  WATI, then re-sync. Editing the body locally won't push anywhere.
